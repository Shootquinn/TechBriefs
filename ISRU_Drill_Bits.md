### Drill Bits / Drill Heads / Coring Heads Fabricated form ISRU Materials on Mars, The Moon, and Planetary Bodies

The 3d printed drill head as described in the ARD3 public release documentation (readme) implied but did not directly mention the use of ISRU materials as feedstock for the fabrication process.

It is noted that some amount of clean feedstock (be it stainless steel, ceramic, or a binder [polymer, cement, glue, or other]) could be used in proportion to Martian/Lunar/Other regolith in order to fabricate drill heads out of in-situ materials.

This has the advantage of leveraging the abrasive and nasty properties of Regolith to the drill oeprators advantage. 

A geometry for the 3d printed drill head could be used that maintains a suitable cutting surface as it wears away (as pictured in the ARD3 releases) and so the drill could operate as a hybrid grinder cutter, by way of cutting edges that are sharp (or sharp enough, or like a scoop, or like an ice shaver) but also abrasive. i.e., if the primary cutting mode does not work, progress can be made by grinding away the substrate while sacrificing the drill head cutting edges and structure.
