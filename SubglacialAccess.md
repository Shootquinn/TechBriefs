## Accessing Subglacial Liquid Enivronments Using a "Mosquito" Probe

Referencing the ARD3 / Borebots drilling architecture, a "Mosquito" module could be fitted to a borebot, drill head, or other device capable of traversing a borehole, in order to perform the final penetration into the subglacial environment. 

This has the potential to allow a permanent ice cork to remain in place at the bottom of the borehole. A thin (relative to the bore diameter) tubular or telescoping tubular "straw" capable of penetrating the cork can be extended from the Mosquito module and can extract samples from the subglacial environment. After sample extraction, the hole is sealed naturally by re-freezing, plastic deformation of the ice due to pressure, or artifically by provisions on the straw or Mosquito module. The module may need to deploy a temporary or permanent stopper to prevent flow up the borehole until sealing can occur. 

Depending on the body being penetrated, and the pressure/temperature of the ice, different thicknesses of the cork will have to be maintained. It is preferable to carefully calculate this cork thickness, rather than drilling all the way through the ice sheet and having a surge of water create a thicker cork, potentially trapping hardware in the frozen hole. 

The straw may be heasted.
