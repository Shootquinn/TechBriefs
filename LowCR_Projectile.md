### Projectile with Extremely Low Coefficient of Restitution for Maximum Momentum Transfer

A projectile to be fired by compressed gas, magnetic railgun, or other conventional means is manufactured to have dry adhesive surface properties (or other adhesive properties capable of ensuring attachment to the target, depending on velocity) and of a suitable hardness and contact surface area such that very little bounce occurs; thus maximuzing the transfer of momentum into the target object for the purposes of measuring the target's mass or to change the trajectory of the target.

Alternately, the projectile can have a mechanical method of interlocking with the target, such as a harpoon-style tip, toggle-bolt style retention mechanism, spikes/spines with retention features that explosviely deploy upon impact, or any other mechanical means to attach itself to the target; thus maximuzing the transfer of momentum into the target object for the purposes of measuring the target's mass or to change the trajectory of the target.
