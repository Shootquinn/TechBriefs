## Transport of Drill Cuttings

Drill cuttings can be transferred to the inside of the downhole bit via holes in the wall of the drill bit in each flight of fluting. To prevent jamming, a "cheese grader" cylinder is inside the tube with the flights and grabs material and deposits it inside of the downhole assembly for storage and transport to the surface. 

The inner "cheese grader" cylinder can be held stationary (in reference to the main downhole assembly and the ground being penetrated) while the bit and flights turn.
