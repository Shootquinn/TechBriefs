## Transport of Drill Cuttings to Support Deep Drilling

Drill cuttings can be transferred to the inside of the downhole bit or auger via holes in the wall of the drill bit, within each flight of fluting. To prevent jamming (this is the key innovation here), a "cheese grader" cylinder is inside the main tube (the one with the fluting), and grabs material and deposits it inside of the downhole assembly for storage and transport to the surface. This cheese-grader action can prevent clogging frequently seen by removing material as it passes through passageways before it has an opporunity to become thightly packed. 

The inner "cheese grader" cylinder can be held stationary (in reference to the main downhole assembly and the ground being penetrated) while the bit or auger turn.
