## Transport of Drill Cuttings to Support Deep Drilling

Drill cuttings can be transferred to the inside of the downhole bit or auger via holes in the wall of the drill bit, within each flight of fluting. To prevent jamming (this is the key innovation here), a "cheese grater" cylinder is inside the main tube (the one with the fluting), and grabs material and deposits it inside of the downhole assembly for storage and transport to the surface. This cheese-grater action can prevent clogging frequently seen by removing material as it passes through passageways before it has an opporunity to become thightly packed. 

The inner "cheese grater" cylinder can be held stationary (in reference to the main downhole assembly and the ground being penetrated) while the bit or auger turn.

This method can also work with auger systems that already contain inner barrels. The cheese-grater action can be applied to yet another inner barrel, or to an outer barel as required. 

The cheese-grater action can be active continuously, or can be activated from time to time via a pin-puller or pin-pusher (or other actuator or action) that creates a temporary mechanical link between the main downhole assembly and the bit or auger, to allow grating action for 1/4 or 1/2 turn, etc. before resuming normal operation. One-quarter or one-half of every full turn could have grating action in this manner; or, one-quarter or one-half of each turn could alternate directions so a back-and-forth grating motion is accomplished every half or full turn.
