### A Process for the Production of Additively Manufactured Objects with Dry Adhesive Properties, Transferred from Buildsheet Substrate

A polymer or metal sheet (rigid or semi-rigid material) is manufactured by conventional methods (as done with ‘normal’ flexible dry adhesives, or as done with the holographic optical elements [like heads-up displays, etc.], daylight redirecting film, Fresnel lenses, or blazed diffraction grating, as appropriate). After manufacture, this sheet is to have the dry adhesive geometery required of the final part (the characteristic sawtooth patern) but must maintain rigidity of the dry adhesive charactersticsc as much as possible. The sheet is then bonded or otherwise affixed to the build platen / build sheet of the additive manufacturing machine / 3d printer. The build sheet or platen may be flat or may be contoured to a desired geometry prior to starting the additive manufacturing on the surface of the build sheet or platen. A polymer is selected for the additive manufacturing proces that will have the desired flexibility and hardness, and is printed on the polymer film containing the dry adhesive properties. After additive manufacturing is complete, the area of contact between the additively manufactured part and the build sheet contains the characteristic geometry of the dry adhesive once removed from the build plate.
